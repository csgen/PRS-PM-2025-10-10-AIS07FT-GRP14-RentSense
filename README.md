## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
### Project Background
The RentSense project represents the second phase of our AI-powered rental recommendation system designed for international students in Singapore. Building upon the foundation established in the IRS Practice Module Project(hereafter referred to as Project 1), which focused on developing an end-to-end platform for property search and multi-objective optimization, RentSense introduces adaptive intelligence through user behavior modeling and advanced re-ranking algorithms.
### Previous Project
In Project 1, the system provided personalized rental suggestions by filtering available properties according to user-specified preferences (such as rent range, proximity to schools, and flat type) and ranking them using a weighted multi-objective optimization model. This framework effectively supported both structured form input and natural language queries through an integrated NLU module.
### Enhancements in RentSense Project
RentSense extends this framework by incorporating behavioral feedback signals—including dwell time and property bookmarking—to enhance recommendation quality. After the initial filtering stage, the candidate properties are re-ranked through a hybrid scoring approach that combines content-based similarity (via property and query embeddings) and collaborative filtering. Additionally, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to predict the dynamic weight of user preferences, allowing the multi-objective optimization process to adapt to each individual’s evolving interests.
